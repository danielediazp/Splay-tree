// 1. Implement duplicates. Difficulty -> eassy
//       Steps:
//         #Add a new data member to the node class 
//         #Add a conditional to the insert method. If the node exist already, update the counter by one. 

// 2. Implement deletion. Difficulty -> Hard 

//   #Find the node. 
//   #check to see if node has childs. If it is a leaf node, cut the node from the tree.
//   #otherwise, some rotation will be needed. 
//   #If Node is the root, find the predecessor or succesor. "Recomender DFS approach" 


//Fix insert. Difficulty -? Med 
//        #Add the splay method in each insert
//        #every element insert in the tree should become the root of the tree 
//        #refer to a youtube video for a deeper understanding 

// 4. If you have any library in mind for graphcis rendering make a post on discord. 
//   for now learn smfl and the following openGL library.
